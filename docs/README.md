Here’s a detailed `README.md` file for your **Water Supply Monitoring System (WSMS)** project:

# Water Supply Monitoring System (WSMS)

## Overview
The **Water Supply Monitoring System (WSMS)** is a Python-based system designed to monitor the water supply in different locations, track parameters like water supply status, water levels, and flow rates. The system continuously monitors water supply conditions, logs the data, and allows for future analysis of water supply conditions.

This system is particularly useful in areas where water supply management is crucial, and efficient monitoring is needed to ensure the availability and quality of water in different regions, especially in developing areas like parts of Africa.

## Features
- **Water Supply Monitoring**: The system tracks the status of water supply in various locations, such as whether the water supply is operational, under maintenance, or out of service.
- **Real-Time Data**: The system monitors and logs water levels and flow rates periodically, providing valuable insights into water usage.
- **Data Storage**: Although it currently simulates data saving, the system is designed to later integrate with a database to store collected data.
- **Frontend**: A simple HTML frontend allows users to see live updates on the water supply status, water levels, and flow rates.
- **Extensibility**: The system can be enhanced with IoT-based real-time sensors for collecting data, predictive analytics for water consumption forecasting, and advanced data visualization on the frontend.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before running the system, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6+ (preferably the latest version)
- Git (for version control)

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Water-Supply-Monitoring-System.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd Water-Supply-Monitoring-System
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - For Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - For Mac/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. Install the required Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. The `requirements.txt` file includes necessary libraries, which can be extended as the project grows.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**: The primary programming language for the backend logic.
- **Flask/Django (optional)**: If you decide to expand the backend into a web application, you can use Flask or Django.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For the frontend, providing real-time data updates.
- **Git**: For version control and collaborative work.

- **`backend/scripts/`**: Contains Python scripts for the system logic, including the `main.py` entry point and the water supply monitor.
- **`backend/models/`**: Defines the data models used by the system, like the `WaterSupply` class that stores water supply information.
- **`backend/controllers/`**: Contains controllers that handle system processes like starting the monitoring loop.
- **`backend/tests/`**: Unit tests for validating the functionality of the models and system logic.
- **`frontend/`**: Contains the HTML and JavaScript for the web interface.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation of the project, including setup instructions, project structure, and more.

## Usage

### Running the System
1. To start the monitoring system, run the main script using:
    ```bash
    python backend/scripts/main.py
    ```

2. The script will start monitoring water supply every minute and print the status to the console.

### Frontend
You can view the frontend by opening `frontend/src/index.html` in any web browser. It will display live updates for the water supply status, water levels, and flow rates (simulated for this prototype).

### Starting the Monitoring Service
- The system will simulate data logging for water supply, including status, water level, and flow rate.
- The system is designed to be easily extendable with real data input, and the simulation provides a basic framework for how data is captured and displayed.

## Testing

1. To test the unit functionality of the `WaterSupply` class, run the tests using:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest backend/tests/test_water_supply.py
    ```

2. Future unit tests can be added for additional features and to ensure that the system scales well.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with IoT devices**: Integrate real sensors to get live data from water supply sources.
- **Data Storage**: Implement a real database to store water supply data permanently.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Add machine learning models to predict water demand or detect anomalies.
- **Visualization**: Create more advanced frontend visuals, such as graphs and charts to show trends in water supply.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile app for easier access to water supply data.
